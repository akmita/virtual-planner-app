components list:

main list 
	goal 1
		milestone 1
		milestone 2	
			weeklyTask 1
			weeklyTask 2
	goal 2
		milestone 1
		milestone 2	
			weeklyTask 1
			weeklyTask 2

event listeners:

goal event listeners:
	edit
	click dropdown milestones

milestone listeners:
	edit
	click dropdown children

try rendering a single goal from the original app
render milestones, inside the main goal container
render weekly tasks inside the container for milestones
bind event listeners

====================================== COOL IDEAS =======================================
imagine sending a link from your web browser to have the app to remind you to read later



======================================= CURRENTLY WORKING ON ========================================
//  each liste item will have a screen
//   screen navigation (app.js): https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation
//   state without component objects: https://reactnative.dev/docs/state 
/// edit button not working, i can pass a parameter and call a console.log statement through it,	
// but once it hits the navigation, it doesn't wanna work, try a statful componnent					FIXED

// instead of edit button, make the whole goal clickable for best UX					FIXED
